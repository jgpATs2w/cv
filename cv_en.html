		<p>Web and Mobile programmer.<br />
Nowadays I'm available for new projects, preferably remote work (with conference meetings).<br />
My experience is diverse, I'm not a 'super expert' in any technology or even in general technologies field. I prefer
to adapt myself to new situations and try to learn always as much as possible, doing my best to get the job done and
to maintain a pleasant human environment.</p>

<h1>Experience</h1>

<p><strong>Field Engineer</strong>-<em>Qualitas Instruments</em> (2003-2007)<br />
<em>plc, matlab, r2422, rs232, rs485, ethernet, hmi, lidar, doppler, windows</em><br />
Developing with Unitronics PLC's to connect analog and smart sensors to client platform networks (nation wide). 
Be part of the whole process (relation with customer, engineering work, development and installation) is hard,
 but with a good team, is very pleasant. Develope directly in the field is too crazy, simulate previously at the lab,
  saves a lot of stress, but is always incomplet: the field has always the n+1 element.  </p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Radar Field Engineer</strong>-<em>Qualitas Remos-Codar</em> (2004-2009)<br />
<em>osx, codar, hfradar, ethernet, bragg, matlab</em><br />
Being the first company installing Codar HF Radar in Spain, as pioners of a key technology to measure ocean current fields, 
was really exciting. Thanks to the effort make by our team, the company has grown to the leadership in this technology for 
most of europe, portugal and morocco. The job included strong relations with the company at California, training at the factory
 and an special combination of researching and engineering.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>System administrator and software developer</strong>-<em>Qualitas Remos</em> (2007-2010)<br />
<em>osx-server, mysql, php, java, gwt, java-me, html, ssh</em><br />
Developing in Java2ME and web techs (PHP and MySQL) we make the QRMS system, a nation wide system to capture water parameter 
fields and show it to users with web interfaces, and communicating the data 'cuasi real time' to Spanish Administration's 
hiydrological information systems. In parallel we included data from Codar Radar HF and other ocean sensors increasing the 
data flow. In the second (actual version) of the system we migrated from PHP+HTML to GWT, delighted by the RPC concept and 
the ease to develop interactive web apps in Java and XML Code. The actual system frontend is much more better than when I 
started it, but i'm still very proud of my collaboration and specially of the work of my colleagues. As <em>system administrator</em>, 
I had the responsability over mysql, apache2 server, apache tomcat server, users,... As developer, I was dealing with design, 
development and testing front and back end apps, server scripting and mysql scripting. First years alone, and last years with 
an excellent team. As development team responsible, I act as the interface between company ceo and development team.  </p>
